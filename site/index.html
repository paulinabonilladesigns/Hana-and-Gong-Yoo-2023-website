<p>Haneul is a five year old South Korean girl. You will often hear people refer to her as "Hana." Although she likes nature, she doesn’t get to spend much time outdoors because of the wintry weather. She is determined to change that this year. Hana and her loyal dog Gong-Yoo are on an adventure to restore the seasons.</p>

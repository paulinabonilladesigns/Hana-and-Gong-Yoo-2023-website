<p>Haneul is a South Korean 5-year-old girl that likes to go by the nickname Hana. She is 4 feet tall but has big dreams and goals. You will often see Haneul wearing her modern winter hanbok. Because of the cold, Hana’s cheeks turn a rosy color. She usually wears a face cover to shelter her from the cold winds.</p>
<h3>Why has Haneul decided to go on an adventure this year?</h3>
<p>South Korea has been experiencing an ongoing winter for over 75 years now. Society has had to learn how to live in these wintry conditions and many do not remember a time before this winter.</p>
	
<p>Being in kindergarten, Haneul has recently learned how to read. Through reading her grandmother’s old books, she has come to discover that life hasn’t always been this cold and bleak. Hana wishes to see a real life Jeju cherry blossom flower and has made it her ultimate goal to do so no matter what. Hana has taken it upon herself to restore the seasons and won’t stop until she does. She and her trusted companion Gong-Yoo have begun their adventures to restore the seasons.</p>
<h3>Who is Gong-Yoo?</h3>

<p>Gong-Yoo is Haneul’s very smart and handsome sidekick. He is a gray terrier mix. Gong-Yoo sports a blue collar and because of the winter, wears a red winter jacket. Gong-Yoo is a very reliable, responsible, and loyal dog who will always find a way to get Haneul and himself out of trouble. </p>
	<h3>I have never heard of South Korea and this 75-year-long winter, is this a fantasy world?</h3>
	<p>You are right! Hana, Gong-Yoo, and this 75-year-long winter have been created as part of a project for the course Introduction to Digital Media, taught at <a href="http://moorparkcollege.edu" target="_blank">Moorpark College</a>.</p></p>
